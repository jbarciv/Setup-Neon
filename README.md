# Setup-Neon

## Description
Changing your linux distro, in most of the cases, is painful and also tiresome, but sometimes it is just necessary. In these situations we are forced to make the effort of remembering all the applications we had installed and try to reinstall them, what in the practice means surfing on internet for hours. But what if we can solve this problem and save all this time just with one *konsole* input?

We present **Setup-Neon** a simple shell script for setting up your Kde Neon desktop enviroment easily and with less efforts. We are intalling what we consider the most relevant applications and eatures, so you are free to comment and uncomment (even add) your own preferences.

With *Setup-Neon* we are presenting a collection of the basic tools that every linux programmer should have installed. Also with some tricks and solving the most usual errors and bugs.
