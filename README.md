# Setting Up Kde-Neon

## Description
Changing your linux distro, in most of the cases, is painful and also tiresome, but sometimes it is just necessary. In these situations we are forced to make the effort of remembering all the applications we had installed and try to reinstall them, what in the practics means surfing on internet looking for help. But what if we can solve this problem and save all this time just with one konsole input?

We present **Setup-Neon** a simple running file for setting up your Kde Neon desktop enviroment easily and with less efforts. We are intalling the applications more relevants for us, so you are free to erase and add your own preferences.

We also present a collection of basic installations shortcut for main apps for Kde Plasma. With some tricks and solving the most usual errors and bugs, we have grouped the important konsole entries.
